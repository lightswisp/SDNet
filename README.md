This is a Silent Distributed Network or SDNet

It works like tor (The Onion Routing), but there are some differences.

In short, the network consits of three layers:
	- First layer is basically a dispenser of available nodes
	- Second layer consists of the main nodes that we got from the first layer
	- Third layer consists of only one exit node that is located in the free of censorship environment

Second layer nodes are basically the "false bottom", they look like usual websites, but in reality they act as a proxy between the exit node.

Exit node acts as a proxy between the uncensored internet.
